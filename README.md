### About the project
I made this website using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

### About me
I'm an engineering student at the Universtiy of Virginia studying computer science. I love casual making personal projects on my own - I think they're a great way to learn new technologies while having fun. Check out my Github for some of my favorite projects.

### Future extensions
- Use a backend to allow more data processing and API usage
- Implement Twitter API to see tweets about a location + restaurant
- Use Yelp's menu data to display the restaurant menu or other data points
- Replace Vue another web framework like Angular
